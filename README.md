# Funnel-and-A-B-Test-Project
An ecommerce store's funnel (customer journey) and A/B marketing campaign test analysis
Description of My Project
In this project, I combined the principles of A/B testing with funnel analysis to create a comprehensive framework for understanding and improving user interaction with a product or service. My focus was not only on determining the effectiveness of changes through A/B testing but also on gaining deeper insights into the customer journey through funnel analysis.

Key Aspects of My Work:
A/B Testing Mastery:

I applied binomial metrics to simplify outcomes in A/B tests, such as analyzing user actions like purchases or clicks.
Emphasized practical application of statistical principles in A/B testing, moving beyond theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios.
In-Depth Learning and Analysis:

Engaged with foundational texts such as "Practical Statistics for Data Scientists" to ground my understanding of statistical concepts.
Delved into specialized materials, including a guide on A/B testing and a detailed blog post on statistical significance in A/B testing, to refine my analytical skills.
Integration with Funnel Analysis:

I leveraged funnel analysis to provide context to the A/B testing results, tracking user progression through different stages of interaction.
This integration allowed me to combine insights from funnel data with A/B test outcomes for a holistic view of changes' effectiveness and user engagement.
Practical Application and Tools:

Utilized a statistical A/B testing calculator, understanding how variations in inputs can influence test outcomes.
Analyzed case studies where funnel analysis and A/B testing were used in tandem, enhancing my ability to interpret complex data sets.
Comprehensive Understanding:

Developed a thorough grasp of key A/B testing concepts, benefits, and common pitfalls.
Learned about the impact of sample size and conversion rates on binomial distributions and gained proficiency in interpreting A/B test results across different Confidence Intervals (CI).
Project Outcomes:
This project showcases my ability to not only conduct A/B testing but also to enrich these tests with funnel analysis insights. By doing so, I enhanced my understanding of user behavior and the overall impact of changes in a business context, making my analysis more comprehensive and actionable.
